## Password-Generator

Cloned the original code and worked on it :

To secure password when you click the button to generate a password you will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
Then you wpuld be prompted for  password criteria then you select which criteria to include in the password
**First you will be prompted for the length of the password between 8 characters and no more than 128 characters**
**Second you will be prompted for character types to include in the password such as lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special character**
When all prompts are answered then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
When the password is generated the passwrod is displayed on the page
